This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project using the App Router and TypeScript.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.x or later
- pnpm 8.x or later ([Installation guide](https://pnpm.io/installation))
- A Resend API key ([Sign up here](https://resend.com))

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Set up your environment variables:

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```bash
# Email Configuration
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
CONTACT_EMAIL=your_destination_email@example.com
SENDER_EMAIL=your_verified_sender@yourdomain.com
```

### Resend API Key Setup

1. Sign up for a Resend account at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. Once logged in, navigate to the API Keys section
3. Create a new API key with the following permissions:
   - `emails.send` - Required for sending emails
   - `domains.read` - Required for domain verification
4. Copy the generated API key and add it to your `.env.local` file
5. Verify your sender email domain in the Resend dashboard:
   - Go to Domains
   - Add your domain
   - Follow the DNS verification steps
   - Wait for domain verification to complete

Note: Make sure to verify your sender email domain with Resend before using it. The verification process may take up to 48 hours.

3. Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
